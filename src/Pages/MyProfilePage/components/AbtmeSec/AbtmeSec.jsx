                    <p>
                        With a degree in Business Administration majoring in Accounting,
                        my career journey took an exciting turn when I followed my passion for technology.
                        In early 2017, I landed a role as a Data Analyst in a collections agency, where I honed my analytical skills.

                        After earning my degree in 2018, I immersed myself in customer service and technical support roles in the BPO industry.
                        Driven by a passion for technology and a background in accounting,
                        I completed a Data Analytics course at Refocus Digital Academy, earning a certificate,
                        and recently graduated from Avion Schoolâ€™s Software Engineering program with a focus on web development.
